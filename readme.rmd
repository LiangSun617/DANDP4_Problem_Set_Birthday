### My Friends' Birthdays

Task: investigate the distribution of your friends' birth months and days using birthday example data.

#### 1.Preparing data
Read the file and take an overview of the data:
```{r}
birthday <- read.csv('birthdaysExample.csv', header = TRUE)
head(birthday)
summary(birthday)
```
![head](/images/1.png)

![sum](/images/2.png)

The dates are written in string format. Extract the birth months and birth days using strptime():

```{r}
birthday$betterdates <- strptime(birthday$dates, "%m/%d/%y")
birthday$month <- format(birthday$betterdates, '%m')
birthday$day <- format(birthday$betterdates, '%d')
birthday$year <- format(birthday$betterdates, '%y')

unique(birthday$year)
```
![year](/images/3.png)

There are only one value for the year in this birthday data. All observations were born in the year of 2014.

#### 2.Exploring data

- How many people share your birthday? Do you know them? (Reserve time with them or save money to buy them a gift!)

  My birthday is on June 17th, so I checked if and how many people have same birthday as mine in the data:

```{r}
mybirthday <- birthday[which(birthday$month == 6
                             & birthday$day == 17),]
nrow(mybirthday)
```
![mybir](/images/4.png)

The answer is that no one shared my birthday in the data.


- Which month contains the most number of birthdays?

  This question is a little ambiguous. Does it mean to find the most number of observations or the most number of unique birthdays among all months? I decide to check both.

  First, to find the month with most number of observations no matter whether they share birthdays:

```{r}
#Change month into a factor
birthday$month <- as.factor(birthday$month)
birthday$day <- as.factor(birthday$day)

library(ggplot2)
qplot(x = month, data = birthday) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(70, 100))  
ggsave('birthHistogram.png')

table(birthday$month)
```
![plot](/images/birthHistogram.png)

![months](/images/5.png)

It is clear that March has most number of people.

  Second, to find the month with most number of unique birthdays:

  ```{r}
  # Create a new data frame that contains the count of birthdays by month
  daymonth <- as.data.frame(table(birthday$day, birthday$month))
  # Rename the columns in the new data frame
  colnames(daymonth)[1] <- 'Date'
  colnames(daymonth)[2] <- 'Month'
  # Drop 0 values of frequency
  daymonth <- daymonth[daymonth$Freq != 0, ]  
  # Show number of unique birthdays of each month
  table(daymonth$Month)
  ```  
![unique](/images/6.png)

From this table, we see that January, July and October have most number of unique birthdays.

- How many birthdays are in each month?

  The exact results can be found in the table above. It is also shown in the graph below:
```{r}
qplot(x = Month, data = daymonth) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(20, 32))
ggsave('uniqueHistogram.png')
```  
![uniplot](/images/uniqueHistogram.png)


- Which day of the year has the most number of birthdays?

```{r}
max_birthday <- daymonth[daymonth$Freq == max(daymonth$Freq),]
```
![max](/images/7.png)

The most popular birthdays are February 6, May 22, and July 16. All of them appear 8 times in the data.

- Do you have at least 365 friends that have birthdays on everyday of the year?

```{r}
table(daymonth$Month)
```
![unique](/images/6.png)

We can see that not every day of every months is a birthday. Only January, July, September and October have birthdays on each day.

Therefore, I do not have 365 friends that have birthdays on every day of the year.
